The BIOMICS project is a Twinning initiative funded by the European Union’s Horizon programme. It is dedicated to supporting researchers, clinicians, and students by equipping them with advanced skills in data science through training programmes, staff exchanges, courses, and conferences.

This hackathon is open to anyone affiliated with one of the BIOMICS institutes. It will take place at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute [(EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)), located on the [Wellcome Genome Campus](https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org/) [in Hinxton (Cambridgeshire), United Kingdom](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/52.07867/0.18460). Attendees from all institutes will work collaboratively on cutting-edge problems in biological data analysis. The hackathon will run for three days, from Monday 23rd to Wednesday 25th of February 2026.


#### Agenda
The [schedule is available]({{< ref "schedule" >}} "schedule").

Generally, the hackathon will consist of 4-5 sessions of group work, bookended by presentations about the problem being worked on.

We will also plan some social events during the hackathon, including a tour of the Wellcome Genome Campus, and a visit to a traditional English pub.
